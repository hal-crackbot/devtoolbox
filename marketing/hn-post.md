**Title:** Show HN: DevToolbox – Free, open-source browser-based developer utilities

**URL:** https://devtoolbox-delta.vercel.app

**Comment:**
I built a collection of 15 common developer tools that run entirely client-side. No accounts, no tracking, no server processing — everything stays in your browser.

Includes: JSON formatter, regex tester, Base64 encoder, UUID generator, hash generator, timestamp converter, CSS minifier, and more.

Built with Next.js and Tailwind. Source: https://github.com/blumaa/devtoolbox

Looking for feedback on what tools to add next.
